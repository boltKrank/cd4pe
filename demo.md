# Demo'ing CD4PE with Hydra

From this point on I will be call my demo environment 'myDemo', so you will need to replace this with the name of you demo environment, including all URLs.

## Spinning up environment from Slack

In the room #team-se-demos, run the command:
`!create <demoName> with <machine_count> machines for <lifetime> days`

This will give you a link to the github CI, so you can see the progress of your demo environment.

Once it has been spun up, you should get the login page, but going to: `https://myDemo-demo.classroom.puppet.com`  (NOTE: it must be HTTPS)

You should get the following screen:
